Howdy! My name is Julio Alvarez, and I am currently looking for a job in the data analytics field. I have a significant amount of knowledge when it comes to Python and R.

While I do not have proper domain knowledge, I am passionate about learning a myriad of areas as I am a longtime learner! I am open to opportunities that relate to Data Science, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Engineering, and Teaching!
