## Greetings from Houston! 👋

Howdy! My name is Julio Alvarez, and I am currently looking for a job in the data analytics field. I have a great amount of knowledge when it comes to Python and R. I will say that I am still a beginner when it comes to SQL, and Tableau/PowerBI, but I am enjoying the process of becoming much more knowledgeable in those platforms. As of right now, I have only created various projects that showcase my skills in the data analytics field. While I do not have proper domain knowledge, I am passionate about learning a myriad of fields as I am a longtime learner! I am open to opportunities that relate to Data Science, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Engineering, and Teaching!
